# A comparison of Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks in performing NLP tasks

This compares the CNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM and GRU models on three NLP Tasks. Each NLP task has its own file: 

- #### Sentiment Analysis Task uses IMBD dataset

- #### POS-Tagging Task uses inbuilt NLTK treebank dataset

- #### Machine Translation Task uses Eng-Ger sentence dataset
